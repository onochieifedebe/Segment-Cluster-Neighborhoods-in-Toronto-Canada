# Segment-Cluster-Neighborhoods-in-Toronto-Canada
## In this project, I will be web scraping data from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M. This data will be the foundation of this project as it will contain the Postal Codes, Boroughs and Neighborhoods in Toronto, Canada.  
## The goal of the project is to use a clustering algorithm, K-Means to be precise, to segment neighborhoods in the North York Borough of Toronto.
